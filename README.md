# DataSynth
# 📊 AI-Powered Dataset Generator

## 🚀 Introduction
In the world of **Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)**, high-quality datasets play a crucial role in training robust models. However, **finding, curating, and structuring datasets** for specific use cases is often challenging and time-consuming.

Our **AI-Powered Dataset Generator** eliminates this problem by leveraging **OpenAI's GPT-4** to generate structured, context-aware datasets based on user inputs. Whether you're working on a **data science project, ML model, or business analysis**, our tool ensures you get a ready-to-use dataset within seconds! 🎉

## ❌ The Problem: Dataset Challenges
🔴 **Finding relevant datasets**: Public datasets may not always match specific requirements.
🔴 **Data cleaning & formatting**: Datasets often require preprocessing, leading to additional effort.
🔴 **Missing values & inconsistencies**: Many datasets have missing or inconsistent data.
🔴 **Time-consuming data collection**: Manually curating datasets is slow and tedious.

## ✅ Our Solution: AI-Powered Dataset Generator
✨ Our tool allows users to simply **describe the dataset context**, specify the number of rows and columns, and instantly generate a structured dataset—complete with a **title, summary, and downloadable CSV format**.

**🔥 Key Features:**
✅ **AI-Generated Dataset Titles**: No need to manually name datasets—our AI fetches a meaningful title based on the context.
✅ **Smart Data Structuring**: Ensures consistent data formatting with **S.No (Serial Number)** and **Target** columns.
✅ **Customizable Columns & Rows**: Users can specify the dataset size for their needs.
✅ **AI-Powered Summary**: Provides a short, insightful summary explaining the dataset.
✅ **Instant CSV Download**: Easily export datasets in **CSV format** for immediate use.
✅ **Auto-Fixing Missing Values**: Handles missing or improperly formatted data to ensure clean datasets.
✅ **User-Friendly & Interactive UI**: Built using **Streamlit**, making it visually appealing and easy to use.

## 🔧 Installation & Setup
Follow these simple steps to set up and run the project on your local machine:

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ai-dataset-generator.git
cd ai-dataset-generator
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
Make sure you have **Python 3.8+** installed. Then, install the required libraries:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Set Up OpenAI API Key
Create an environment variable for your **OpenAI API key**:
```sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'  # macOS/Linux
set OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'     # Windows (Command Prompt)
```

Alternatively, add this line to your Python script:
```python
import os
os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = 'your-api-key-here'
```

### 4️⃣ Run the Application
```sh
streamlit run app.py
```

The web app will now be available at **http://localhost:8501** 🎉
